The game has a simple question game to dictate what character you get based on a desired and 
undesired stat. The current system works fine, so there is a lot of room for improvement.

HOW TO ORGANIZE
A data organizing package like numpy should be utilized as there is a lot of data to track
that interwine. Data gathered should also be stored in a csv since results would only change
when stat values are updated by extracting google docs data.

Per Character 
    -Name, 
    -Stat Aptitudes
    -combos that result in this character

Per Combo
    - desired stat and undesired stat and the resulting char
    - ties
    - runner up chars that lost to the winning combo 

Per Stat
    -Combos where this stat is desired and who it results
    -ditto but undesired

To simplify, the Combo data row should be
Desired Stat Name, & Val, Lesser Stat Name, & Val, difference of vals, Associated Character Name

Then with the set of all combos, 
    create a new set 
    where 
    combos of the max difference when compared to combos of the same stat names are only present, 
    ties included.
