~~~~~~~~~~~STATS~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

---------------------------------Stat Calcuation---------------------------------
Creatures have stats with values which will be multiplied by their Aptitude values 
to get their true stat value

When Apt is positive, each point of apt =
25% increments (add to value after multiplication)

When negative, each point is =
12.5% decrements when negative (multiplying by fraction)

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::EX::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Apt:      8    4    0      -1       -2       -3       -4
Mult:     2    1    0     0.875,   0.75,    0.625,    0.5
Effect:  3x    2x   1x    -12.5%   -25%    -37.5%    -50%


---------------------------------Stat Abbreviations---------------------------------

Strength - str = s
Defense - def = d
Evasion - eva = e
Dexterity - dex = dx
Recovery - rec = r
Intellect - int = i
Creativity - cre = c
Fear - fear = f
Intimidation - itmd = it
Charisma - cha = ch
Stress - tres = ss
Health - hp = h
Hunger - hun = hu
Energy - ap = a

~~~~~~~~~~~~BATTLE PEEPS~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-----------------Minimum VALUES-----------------
The value of a stat can not be less than 1 


-----------------DEFAULT VALUES-----------------
Each character start with a stat value based on their apt as so:

 apt = val
  8 = 30
  7 = 27
  6 = 25
  5 = 22
  4 = 20
  3 = 17
  2 = 15
  1 = 12
  0 = 10
  -1 = 9
  -2 = 8
  -3 = 6
  -4 = 5

hp
100 for all, then apt calc

ap
10 for all, then apt calc

-----------------CREATION---------------
Character stats are kept in a google sheets doc for easy updates on different devices.

Gather Character Stats:
Reads google sheet, updates this project csv file containing data, data is read on build.

Enemy Creator:
>Dictate stats you want to be high or low
>algorithm will auto make enemy using 18 point max to create enemy aptitudes (similar to our chars)
Maybe can customize how many apt points are available given enemy difficulty/level
difficulty being: trash, regular, elite, miniboss, boss
>then can take apt vals and assign corresponding stat vals multiplied by stage, desired difficulty, 
or by random range. 
Perhaps dictate stat vals you want to be high/low for more variation 
(low stat, high apt or vis versa)
> These Enemies are then saved and stored in a csv to be read similarly to the character csv
