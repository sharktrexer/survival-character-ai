                        ~~~~~~~~~~~PLAYERS, ALLIES, ENEMIES, OBJECTS~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The meat of the game involves a character that a user controls and other characters and objects to
interact with. There can be many ways for each thing to interact with one another but some
objects dont need to work exactly like characters. 

Another modular architecture is required so that these different things can be interacted with
in similar ways, but not every way. A chest object can be interacted with to open, or for a button
object to be pressed to open a door, but you cant open up a character.

                                  ~~~OBJECTS VERSUS CHARACTERS~~~
       Characters:
-Will always have a health pool and stats
-Contains AI except for the Player

        Objects:
-sometimes cant be hurt
-dont need stats beyond health if it can be hurt (maybe def and eva?)
-will probably be immune to psychological and physical status effects (like charm and prone)

      Shared Features:
-can be afflicted with status effects (though immunity is up to the entity)
-can show up in combat
-can drop items
-can do an action (an object could be a trap that shoots arrows every couple of seconds)
-can activate events (characters on death or objects on interact)
-can be spawned by anything
-can be interacted with
-has a variable dictating if someone can perceive it (otherwise a silhouette of varying accuracy)
