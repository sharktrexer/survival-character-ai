While at the base the player will be able to choose an activity to spend time doing in exchange for
stat boosts. The AI controlled peeps will do the same and thus will require a system to choose
activities for them while remembering their past choosen activities.
Model-based reflex agents fit the bill :O. (Perhaps goal-based too)

``````````````````````````````````````````````Activities``````````````````````````````````````````````
These are what the player and ai can choose to boost their stats for upcoming fights.
Their attributes are:

Location: 
    Where in the cabin they are, like kitchen or garden.
Stat boosts: 
    What stats are upgraded
    Is it aptitude or base values? (max val for HP, AP, Stress)
Stat reductions: 
    What other stats are nerfed to balance out big boosts.
Time Necessary:
    How many minutes/hours required to complete the task.
    Some can be a variable amount set by the peep.
Cost/Refill:
    Activites all have a Stress costs if the activity is not relaxing
    Few characters may have activities they find relaxing that others don't
    Sometimes there can be an HP cost if something goes wrong or is very risky
    Relaxing activities refund Stress
    Example: Sleep completely refills Stress, Health, and Energy
        Eating fills Hunger
Resource Relation:
    If the activity require other resources (like food) or produces resources 
    (like gardening or barricading)
Tags:
    Simple descriptors of activities that different characters will be attracted to or that 
    describe the outcome
    Examples:
        Calming - stress free
        Dirty - deals with dirt or grime
        Naturific - deals with plants
        Resourcing: Large, Some, Lil, None, Loosing, Costly, Expensive
        Unhelpful - doesn't do much for the base
        Communal - helps the base

``````````````````````````````````````````````Time Limit``````````````````````````````````````````````
Depending on a character's Energy Aptitude, they can only stay awake for so long and 
require a certain amount of sleep.

                                            Sleep Schedule
Time Spent Asleep:
    With 0 Energy Aptitude or Higher: 
        peeps need 8 hours of sleep.
    Per point of Energy Apt below 0: 
        peeps need +1 more hrs of sleep (12 max)

Time Spent Awake:
    Per point of Energy Aptitude above 0: 
        Peep can stay awake +1 hrs without negative effects (16 max)
    At 0 Energy Aptitude or lower: 
        Peep can stay awake for 8 hrs


                                                Careful:
When peeps are asleep they cannot assist in any attacks on the base.
They can wake up to help, but doing so will increase amount of stress recieved, by 10% per hr of sleep
they still need.
After disrupting their sleep, they will need a full required amount of sleep again.

AI peeps can be woken up by the player, however they
will always go back to sleep if they have a 30% penalty or higher, after the attack is over.
If there is no attack, they will go back to sleep and reduce their relation with you.

``````````````````````````````````````````````AI Choices``````````````````````````````````````````````

The AI will have certain variables to determine their choices. The higher level AI won't know
any of these things and instead use functions to return a number representing the priority of possible
choices. Then a choice will be made using the highest priority number alongside some slight randomness.

Deciding Factors:
    The perferences AI will make descisions based of off:
    -The current game stat (base food supply, ingredient supply, barricade health, peeps alive)
    -List of preferences each ordered descendingly:
        desired stats 
        desired activity tags (night vs day versions)
        other peeps and their relation to this peep
    -A history of their choices
    -Their current stats (including sleep stat)
    -Their goals (what they want their choices to culminate towards)
    -Special cases

    Game State:
        The resources at base including who is alive, time of day.
        If there are a lot of ingredients but no cooked food, 
            then gardening will have a lower priority.
        The more peeps are dead the more practical activites will be priotizied 
            (food prep vs video gaming)

    Preferences:
        The most basic choices will first be made using these ordered lists, with 
        other factors multiplying the priority.
        Peeps will each have their own lists sorted in order of priority, (0 being the lowest)
        such as:
            -what stats they prefer growing over others, avoiding activities
            that reduce high priority stats; 
            -what types of activities they like participating in more than others, with a 
            different list for night and day; 
            -what other peeps they enjoy doing activities with based on the relationship 
            they have with other peeps and their overall sociability.

    History:
        What choices they have made and what the results were. The AI
        will check their choice against history to determine if they should change things up
        or it has been too long since a favorite actvity of a peep

    Stats:
        Choices will be check against their stats to determine if the increase of stats should be
        higher priority. 
        Ex: Running out of awake hrs will progressivly make Sleeping higher priority.
            Having high stress will prioritize calming activities
            Having low hunger will prioritize eating

    Special Cases:
        Some peeps may do specific activities due to specific conditions that override the 
        priority system. This can be simple like "Day 2: Eat sandwich"


                                        How Do we Assign Number Values?!
store activity and preference data in csv!!!!!

                                            Preference lists
Stat and Peep Lists will have their least desired element on the end with a priority val
of 0, with every element gaining a +5 val from the previous element.
    EX: slice of stat list would be [Strength, Hunger, Dexterity] with vals: [10, 5, 0] 

These values are then multiplied based on the goals of the AI.
    EX: Ray really wants more strength, so Strength would be at the top of the list
        and then multiplied by 2 for a total val of 20
    EX: Everybody wants to increase their Defens in preperation for the final battle,
        so def priority will gain a x5 mult.

                                            Scaling Mults
The lists regarding peep relationships and desired activity will have varying mults depending
on different circumstances. Since the list will affect the base priority of a preference, an
additional number should be added to the base priority so the multiplier isn't entirely decreased
by a low base priority, e.i. to prevent the bottom prefence having no multiplier effect (since it is 0),
a median priority value will first be added to its priority before multiplying.

For Peep Relationship List:
    The list is still ordered by best relationship, but the value of the relationship meter will
    add or multiply the priority. So if the relationship meter is at 100 for 2 people, then the 
    priority should be equal amongst them, despite one of the peeps having to be further up the 
    list than the other.
        EX: [Jayce, Cindy] with relationship 100 each should NOT give priority values [10, 5]
        but instead both [10, 10]. Then with an example mult of 2: [20, 20]

    When looking at an activity that contains 2+ people, the relationship priorities should be combined.
    This will make any activity with 2+ friends have great priority, unless they are not in a social mood.

    Relationship can also be negative, causing the lowest priority of 0 in most cases.

For Activity List:
    Still ordered as expected, however the 2 lists will have their values slowly change based
    on time of day, with the day list decreasing as it turns night while increasing as it turns day,
    and the night list would work inversely. Once a certain time is hit though, one of the lists should
    get a boosted priority so that there isn't a period of time where both lists have exact equal
    priority vals.

    EX: Day list [cook, patrol, garden], Night List [bedroom, game, cook, work-out(inside)]
    Priority Vals:
        During Day: [15, 10, 5] and [0,0,0,0]
        Midday: [15, 10, 5] and [5, 1, 0, 0]
        Night: [0, 0, 0] and [15, 10, 5, 1]



HOW THE NUMBERS WORK:

The baseline priority values in the list should start at 0 and build up to 14x5 = 70
(5 x number of stats)
