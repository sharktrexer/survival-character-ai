While at the base the user will be able to choose an activity to spend time doing in exchange for
stat boosts. The AI controlled peeps will do the same and thus will require a system to choose
activities for them while remembering their past choosen activities.
Model-based reflex agents fit the bill :O. (Perhaps goal-based too)

``````````````````````````````````````````````Activities``````````````````````````````````````````````
These are what the player and ai can choose to boost their stats for upcoming fights.
Their attributes are:

Location: 
    Where in the cabin they are, like kitchen or garden.
Stat boosts: 
    What stats are upgraded
    Is it aptitude or base values? (max val for HP, AP, Stress)
Stat reductions: 
    What other stats are nerfed to balance out big boosts.
Time Necessary:
    How many minutes/hours required to complete the task.
    Some can be a variable amount set by the user.
    The energy stat dictates how long a peep can stay awake before sleeping for 8hrs
Cost/Refill:
    Activites all have a Stress costs if the activity is not relaxing
    Few characters may have activities they find relaxing that others don't
    Sometimes there can be an HP cost if something goes wrong or is very risky
    Relaxing activities refund Stress
    Example: Sleep completely refills Stress, Health, and Energy
Resource Relation:
    If the activity require other resources (like food) or produces resources 
    (like gardening or barricading)
Tags:
    Simple descriptors of activities that different characters will be attracted to or that 
    describe the outcome
    Examples:
        Calming - stress free
        Dirty - deals with dirt or grime
        Naturific - deals with plants
        Resourcing: Large, Some, Lil, None, Loosing, Costly, Expensive
        Unhelpful - doesn't do much for the base
        Communal - helps the base

``````````````````````````````````````````````Time Limit``````````````````````````````````````````````
Depending on a character's Energy Aptitude, they can only stay awake for so long and 
require a certain amount of sleep.

                                            Sleep Schedule
Time Spent Asleep:
    With 0 Energy Aptitude or Higher: 
        peeps need 8 hours of sleep.
    Per point of Energy Apt below 0: 
        peeps need +1 more hrs of sleep (12 max)

Time Spent Awake:
    Per point of Energy Aptitude above 0: 
        Peep can stay awake +1 hrs without negative effects (16 max)
    At 0 Energy Aptitude or lower: 
        Peep can stay awake for 8 hrs


                                                Careful:
When peeps are asleep they cannot assist in any attacks on the base.
They can wake up to help, but doing so will increase an amount of stress recieved, by 10% per hr of sleep
they still need.
After disrupting their sleep, they will need a full required amount of sleep again.

AI peeps can be woken up by the player, however they
will always go back to sleep if they have a 40% penalty or higher, after the attack is over.
If there is no attack, they will go back to sleep and reduce their relation with you.

``````````````````````````````````````````````AI Choices``````````````````````````````````````````````

The AI will have certain variables to determine their choices. The higher level AI won't know
any of these things and instead use functions to return a number representing the priority of possible
choices. Then a choice will be made using the highest priority number alongside some slight randomness.

Memory:
    The perferences AI will store a representation of:
    -List of preferences each ordered descendingly:
        desired stats 
        desired activity tags 
        other peeps and their relation to this peep
    -A history of their choices
    -Their current stats (including sleep stat)
    -Their goals (what they want their choices to culminate towards)

    History:
        What choices they have made and what the results were. The AI
        will check their choice against history to determine if they should change things up
        or it has been too long since a desired actvity (like drinking)

    Stats:
        Choices will be check against their stats to determine if the increase of stats should be
        higher priority. Having low sleep will make Sleeping the highest priority.
