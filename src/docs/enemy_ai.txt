Require a comprehensive helper class to give helpful battle state info 
and simulate casting of actions

Simulating an action cast will produce vital info about its effect
Before a simulation, all valid targets are gathered per each action
This ensures uncastable actions are ignored

Enemy can then compare the info against its goals to see if it a good move

EXAMPLE 
Goals:
    Offensive, Defensive, Buff
    Low def enemies | high rec allies
    Selfishness: low

Best Stats:
    STR, DEF

Worst Stat:
    Int

Allies:
    low DEF, high REC Healer
    Copy of Self

Enemies:
    low DEF 
    high INT, DEF

Moves:
    > 0.5 Str, 0.5 Dex Attack 
            (targ: low DEF enemy)
    > 1 Int Attack
            (targ: low DEF enemy)
    > Block
    > Evade
    > Def Buff
            (targ: low DEF Ally)



TURN:
    Gather best targets for each move first. 
    If something force changes a target, that is ok, use the forced target in calcs.

    Simulate moves:
    
    ACTION 1
    >Str, DEX attack on low DEF Enemy = 15 dmg 
        Compared with high priority Offensive Goal, x3 point(?), 
        + 1 for amount of dmg calced with dmg / offensive stat value used = 1x3 = 3 points
    >int attack on low DEF enemy = 5 dmg, ditto but +0.1 for damage = 0.1x3 = 0.3 points
    >Block = 50 defP for self
        Ap used on flexible move determined by defensive priority
            Since 2nd priority, used 2/max priorities of Ap for cast
        Compared to 2nd priority Defensive Goal, x2 point, 
        defp / def stat used = 1.5 = 1x1.5 = 3 points 
        If already have defP, AND gained defP < cur defp 
            reduce points by -(cur defp/gained defp)
    >Evade = 10 evaP
        + x2 point
        + 0.25 for little evahp gained = 0.5 points
    >Def Buff = +20% Def for 3 trns
        3rd priority = x1 points
        per turn +0.5 = +1.5 
        +0.2 per precent = +0.4 = 1.9 points
        If prime target has buff already at high duration, -50% points
        If haven't casted this in a while, +100% points

    ACTION 2
        if still cast, only travel through actions that are above or equal to median point
        Median = 1.9
        Look further into:
            >Def Buff
            >Block
            >Str/Dex attack
        Now go through simulate func again each,
        passing in the user state
