Generic (most units will have this)

    Basic Attack (Uses STR, + DEX or INT; depending on peep/weapon, attacks DEF)
    Defend (Uses DEF,
        Every 1 ap used gives 30% of Def as Defense Health
        Defense Health provides full defense against attacks vs 1/4 of defense like usual
        Defense health is hurt the same amount that hp is
        User can choose to have attack be affected by block or not to keep Defense Health up
        It heals 25% per any enemy turn passed)
    Evade (Uses EVA,
        Every 1 ap used gives 30% of Eva as Evasion Health
        Evasion health converts every recieved attack into 1x of attacker's dexterity
        Converted attack is only the 1x Dex and all other effects are ignored
        While Evasion Health is active, it takes damage instead of HP
        If the dexterity attack breaks the evasion health, the attacker takes the original attack
        User can choose to have attack be affected by evade or not to keep Evasion Health up)
    Sabotage (Attacks gauge stat (not hp))
    Encourage (Heals gauge stat (not hp))
    
    Shove (Change enemies stance to Knocked Down = (
        Loose Evade Health, Vulnerable to specific, and intimidating moves,
        Resistant to ranged moves). 

        Requires: 
        1.5x STR to be more than target's (current HP / 2) + current health ratio * Def
        Dex to be greater than target's current health ratio * EVA + (Evade Health / 4)
    )
