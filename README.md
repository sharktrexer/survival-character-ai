# Survival Character AI

An in progress LLM-AI-wrapper and game that assists in creating your survival character to fight and survive in a terminal. LLM will require your own Gemini API key, but won't be required to play.

1. Answer generated questions to determine your character stats, from Strength to Creativity to Energy.
2. Work with other simulated characters to survive in the terminal by growing, harvesting, and cooking food; building barricades, and fending off attacks.
3. Fight creatures with your team using turn based combat while leveraging your statistical advantages.

# Examples

Spider charts for each character and their distribution of 18 stat points, within a range of -4 to 8.
